      Trump’s masterful peacemaking falters as a fragile energy ceasefire with
      Putin unravels and Israel resumes strikes on Gaza, killing hundreds
      despite his earlier boasts of being able to end wars quickly. While

      exposing Trump’s diplomatic grandstanding as powerless against deepening
      chaos…

    <h3>Wisconsin Supreme Court Election LOOMS</h3>

    <p>
      As editor in chief of this newsletter, I know stuff can look pretty bleak

      what you can helps this a ton. Additionally, this race is probably the
      biggest thing you can put your effort towards right now. Elon’s throwing
      around his weight quite a bit in this election, so if you want to take
      some wind out of his sails come help out! Elections on April 1st, so
      andale muchacho!
