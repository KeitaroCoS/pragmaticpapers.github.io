      Today, I attended my first Young Democrats meeting alongside one of my
      squad members. I met the Mayor's son, who invited me to go canvassing on
      sunday - not sure yet who for. We discussed requests from congressman
      Georg Latimer's staff, who are looking for Federal Employees impacted by
      DOGE - The Young Dem president is in a group chat with these key staffers.
      I heard about an event next week I'll be excited to attend: An "Empty
      Chair" town hall in my partner's hometown featuring the ghost of
      Republican Congressman Michael Lawler, who's corporal form we suspect will
      not be in attendance. I was able to push back against extreme ideas -
      court packing and doomerism - during the open discussion. I had fun, met
      some awesome people, and found some clear next steps in just 2 short hours
      - 3 games of League, for those of you on degen time.

      This week, dozens of your peers took the same first humble step. Today,
      they will be sharing their stories on reddit, and inviting you to join
      them.

      The number one lesson that we learned during the '24 canvassing program
      was the raw power of "Just showing up". The Arizona team was invited from
      a public meeting to an insider meeting, and eventually got to sit down
      directly with their congressional candidate. Bryce and the NV house were
      able to connect with fundraisers and ended up funding both the NV and PA
      events. Everyone who attended events was able to draw volunteers, make
      connections, meet a cool figure, and generally have a great time.

      You might show up and find that the group isn't a good match for you, or
      that it is too dense with speeches and fluff for you to connect with
      anyone there. You might not be ready to talk up the room the first time
      you walk into it. But you guarantee nothing interesting happens if you
      decide to stay home. Every single time you get your ass out into the
      world, you are making progress. You are building yourself up. You are
      giving yourself odds. You are taking the next step. And you are making a
      difference.
